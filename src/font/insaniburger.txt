Thanks for downloading "Insaniburger" from Insanitype! Font Design.  This zip file contains "Insaniburger Regular" and "Insaniburger with Cheese".  "Insaniburger Regular" is based on the old Burger King logo that's still seen on some of the signs in smaller cities.  "Insaniburger with Cheese" is based on the new logo, which is somewhat similar to the old one, but with a playful yet futuristic twist.  Use it for anything, and let me know if you do!
